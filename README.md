## Hi there! I'm Lucas Keller

I'm an **EmbeddedðŸ“» software engineer** with a passion for learning and computer science. Currently, I'm studying deep learning, algorithms, and web development- mostly through projects and lots of reading. I'm always focused on expanding my skillset and utilizing new technologies to get results.

Professionally, I mostly write c++/python, thus several projects here are prototypes/experiments to mix it up.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Languages**: C++, Python (professionally); Rust, JavaScript, C, (hobbyist)
- **Operating Systems**: Linux > Mac > Windows
- **Libraries**: C++ Boost, React, Node.js, FastAI, PyTorch
- **Databases**: Sqlite3, PostreSQL, Some MongoDB
